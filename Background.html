		<p> Informally known as "Truman Syndrome", the Truman Show Delusion is a type of delusion in which the person believes their lives are staged reality shows, being watched by cameras 24/7
		The term "Truman show Delusion" was coined in 2008 by psychiatrist Joe Gold and neurophilosopher, Ian Gold.

		<p> The Truman Show was a comedy film released in 1998 in which Jim Carrey portrays a man who discovers he is living in a constructed reality that is televised around the world. All of the people in his life are paid actors, as he uncovers the truth about his reality he fights to escape from those controlling his life. The film was inspired by an episode in 1989 of the Twilight Zone titled "Special Service". In this episode the protagonist learns that his life is being broadcasted 24/7 to viewers worldwide. Many science fiction books repeat this same theme of a secretely broadcasted reality but none share the reality show aspect of the Truman Show. </p>

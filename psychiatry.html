		<h2><strong>Delusions</strong></h2>
		<p> Delusions are fabricated beliefs firmly mainted despite being contradicted by generally accepted norms or rational argument. In the abscence of organic disease, they indicate symptoms of psyhicatric disease. The content of these delusions varies but have been found to be tied to life experiences. The Truman Show Delusioon represents an evolution in the content of persecutory delusions in reaction to a changing pop culture.</p>

		<h3><strong> Truman Syndrome </strong></h4>
			<p>In the United Kingdom, psychiatrists Paolo Fusar-Poli, Oliver Howes, Lucia Valmaggia and Philip McGuire of the Institute of Psychiatry in London described in the British Journal of Psychiatry what they referred to as the "Truman Syndrome":

			[A] preoccupying belief that the world had changed in some way that other people were aware of, which he interpreted as indicating he was the subject of a film and living in a film set (a ‘fabricated world’). This cluster of symptoms ... is a common presenting complaint in individuals ... who may be in the prodromal phase of schizophrenia.

			The authors suggest that the "Truman explanation" is a result of the patients' search for meaning in their perception that the ordinary world has changed in some significant but inexplicable way. The Truman Show delusion is not officially recognized and is not a part of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. The Golds do not say that it is a new diagnosis but refer to it as "a variance on known persecutory and grandiose delusions."</p>
